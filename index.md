## A Little About Myself

Hi my name is Shawn Pea and I'm currently a senior majoring in Cybersecurity at GWU with a May 2020 graduation date in sight. Within the cybersecurity field, I have a keen interest in system hardening and penetration testing. I aspire to one day start my own cybersecurity consulting business where I focus on providing affordable solutions for small-businesses that are at high-risk from cyber attacks.
