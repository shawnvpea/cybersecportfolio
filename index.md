## A Little About Myself

Hi my name is Shawn Pea and I'm currently a senior majoring in Cybersecurity at GWU with a May 2020 graduation date in sight. I have a keen interest in network security, system hardening and penetration testing. I aspire to one day start my own cybersecurity consulting business where I focus on providing affordable solutions for small-businesses that are at high-risk from cyber attacks. 

## Academic & Personal Security Projects

#### AWS Compliance Audit (HIPAA)

Using CloudSploit a Cloud-based security and configuration scanner, I evaluated an AWS environment hosting a Windows Server 2016 and RHEL7 EC2 instance for HIPAA compliance. While compiling the scan results from the assessment, I was able to remediate several vulnerabilities and ensure HIPAA compliance. 

#### Google Chrome DoD STIG

As a part of my IT System Auditing class, I was tasked with evaluating a Google Chrome DoD STIG and remediating a variety of CAT 1-3 vulnerabilties. With guidance from the DoD STIG, I was able to deploy GPO policies that hardened Google Chrome in alignment with DoD standards. 

#### Capital Region Advanced Cyber Range

As a part of my securing operating systems and network security course, I was given access to a cyber range that allowed for the configuration and testing of several network security architectures. Through several hands-on course assignments, I was tasked with configuring and implementing network security appliances such as Cisco Adapative Security Appliance, Snort, StrongSwan and OpenVPN. Concluding my coursework in both classes, I was able to learn lots about firewall configurations and implementing site to stie VPN solutions.
