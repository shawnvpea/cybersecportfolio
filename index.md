Using CloudSploit a Cloud-based security and configuration scanner, I evaluated an AWS environment hosting a Windows Server 2016 and RHEL7 EC2 instance for HIPAA compliance. While compiling the scan results from the assessment, I was able to remediate several vulnerabilities and ensure HIPAA compliance. 

#### Google Chrome DoD STIG

As a part of my IT System Auditing class, I was tasked with evaluating a Google Chrome DoD STIG and remediating a variety of CAT 1-3 vulnerabilities. With guidance from the DoD STIG, I was able to deploy GPO policies that hardened Google Chrome in alignment with DoD standards. 

#### Capital Region Advanced Cyber Range

As a part of my securing operating systems and network security course, I was given access to a private cloud environment that allowed for the configuration and testing of several network security architectures. Through several hands-on course assignments, I was tasked with configuring and implementing network security appliances such as Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance, Snort, StrongSwan and OpenVPN. Concluding my coursework in both classes, I was able to learn lots about firewall configurations and implementing site to site VPN solutions.
